# OME-Zarr

Kiln supports two input formats:

| Format | Preprocessing | Use Case |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **OME-Zarr (NGFF v0.4/v0.5)** | None — no Kiln-specific conversion | Standard scientific imaging format, chunked arrays |
| **Kiln sharded binary** | Requires [conversion script](/data/sharded-binary) | Gzip-compressed bricks, HTTP Range streaming |

Kiln can load compatible multiscale [OME-Zarr](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) volumes directly over HTTP, with no Kiln-specific conversion. Point it at a `.ome.zarr` URL and it streams chunk data on demand.

Kiln is listed in the [OME-NGFF tools registry](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/tools/).

## Requirements

- **OME-NGFF v0.4 and v0.5** with `multiscales` metadata in group attributes
- **Single-channel or multichannel** — up to 4 channels (see [Multichannel](/rendering/multichannel))
- **3D arrays** with dimensions ordered `[z, y, x]` (standard C-order); multichannel datasets use a `c` axis
- **Supported dtypes:** `uint8`, `uint16`, `float32` input (signed integers and `float64` not supported)
- Multiple resolution levels (datasets within `multiscales`) are used as LODs
- Voxel spacing is read from `coordinateTransformations` if present
- OMERO metadata is used for per-channel window auto-leveling when available

> **Note:** Currently unsupported: more than 4 channels, signed integer types (`int8`, `int16`), and `float64`. `uint16` and `float32` volumes are stored internally as `r16float` (WebGPU filterable-float32 is not universally available, and there's no native 16-bit-integer alternative in use here); this is not bit-exact across the full `uint16` range. min/max range is read from metadata and used to normalise values in the shader.

## Usage

Pass the `.ome.zarr` URL directly to `KilnViewer.create()`:

```typescript
import { KilnViewer } from 'kiln-render';

const viewer = await KilnViewer.create(canvas, 'https://example.com/data/scan.ome.zarr');
```

Kiln auto-detects the format from the URL. Brick assembly (fetching Zarr chunks, decompressing, and re-chunking into 66³ bricks with ghost borders) runs in a Web Worker pool off the main thread.

## Public OME-Zarr datasets

The [OME-Zarr Open SciVis Datasets](https://registry.opendata.aws/ome-zarr-open-scivis/) on AWS provide ready-to-use test volumes:

```typescript
const viewer = await KilnViewer.create(
  canvas,
  'https://ome-zarr-scivis.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v0.5/96x2/beechnut.ome.zarr',
);
```

## Axis convention

Zarr stores dimensions as `[z, y, x]` (C-order, x fastest-varying). Kiln uses `[x, y, z]` in its metadata. Only metadata tuples are swapped; no data transposition is needed since the memory layout is identical.
